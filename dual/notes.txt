-SplitPowellSabine (&SplitElementsAlfeld) dont count as refinements for the multigrid 

-barycentric Refinement from ngspetsc?

-v.nr for node id

-Prolongation?

-Can i activate unused dofs on coarse mesh?

-BuildSearchTree in Netgen mesh, what does it doo?

-Check FinalizeUpdate in function space classes

- is there a function to get parent edges?

Edges of unrefined mesh are still accesible

Mapping to coarse mesh:
    -NGSolve methods (GetParentXXX) dont work because SplitPowellSabine does not count as a refinements
        3 Options:
            ->Implement own barycentric Refinement (could alse extend to 3d) that counts as refinement for NGsolve (could use Prolongation, I think)
            ->Do it manually on Ngsolve side (get vertices and recoonstruct old element that way) OR (set faces as regions and after refinement check whats inside)
            
            
            Works for L2: Only Assumption elements in netgen and ngsolve have same numbering
            ->Do it on netgen side
                ->using ngsolve element nr in the netgen MacroElementNr works, dont know if correct or just int ranges are same accidentaly


Mapping Matrix needs further research
    -do the (already existing) vertices keep their number after barycentric Refinement? find out
        ->if yes, H1 is possible aswell

DONE: 
    -reconstruct L2 basis function on coarse Mesh
    -H1 dual space

    -reconstruct H1 basis function on coarse Mesh (requires Assumption that already existing vertices keep numbering)
